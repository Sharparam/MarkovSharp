Hey
Anyone there?
*drums fingers*
Hey man.
my liege
Listen, there's this thing I need you to do for me
anything my liege
what army must i lay to waste
whose lands shall i decimate for ur glory
Um, yeah, I'm good on decimation for today. We're going to hold off on the decimation for, like, a week or so.
ok?
I was thinking. How much trouble do you think it would be to have a thermostat installed in the Throne Room?
...
y?
It's really really cold in here.
I'm Lord of the Scourge. I think I should get a thermostat.
no its a frozen throne
Right
See that's exactly what I'm talking about. The throne is frozen. The chair that I sit on all day? Literally a block of ice.
It is so very, very cold.
I actually cannot over-emphasize how cold I am on a daily basis.
but its supposed to be frozen
its the source of ur power
About that. Can I get my power transferred to some other source?
Something that isn't made out of ice that I then have to literally sit on?
Someone dropped the ball there.
ok so like what should it be then
like a ring?
A ring?
Seriously, a ring.
Do you _read_ history?
so what then
I don't know. I'll think about it. Maybe an armoire.
armor?
No, not armor. An armoire. The furniture.
Oh but speaking of armor
I have skulls on my kneecaps.
ok?
No, it is _not_ okay.
I have skulls.
On my _kneecaps_.
well for the thermostat i think u need approval from a supervisor
ill just get kiljaeden in here and well sort it out
No!
no its cool
No, don't...
Ugh, my old boss. I hate this guy.
Ok I'll just...I'll act casual. Like old times.
This had better be important.
yeah lich king here just wants a warmer throne room is all
Warmer?
No it's really not necessary sir
You want a warmer throne room?
yeah
No
yeah he does
I really don't.
Ok sure let me just get right on that
I actually know these guys, they're really great, literally made out of fire
They could heat your room right up for you
They're called the Burning Legion...why don't I just invite them to Azeroth so they can come and
OH WAIT
Someone's too busy being Chatty Cathy to PREPARE HIS WORLD FOR AN APOCALYPSE
So sorry sir
hey cmon though its not like weve just been sitting around
were spreading plague and stuff
we totally spread a lot of plague
and dont forget the spider war
Actually I wouldn't mention that...
Oh yes. The "Spider War."
The "war" where you spent ten years getting rid
OF SPIDERS
Check it out, I had a Mosquito War last night. Mosquito lands on me, I squish it. Done. Two seconds.
Didn't take me ten years
BECAUSE I'M NOT AN IDIOT
Yes sir
Very sorry sir.
I'm on it.
Y'know what, you know who else might want to hear about this
Maybe I shold get Sargeras in here
sure
NO! That's not necessary
Hold on I'll go get him.
ARE YOU CRAZY
"Sure"? Do you know who Sargeras actually is??
i think so hes alliance right
...
horde?
*headdesk*
hay guise whats goin on in dis chat

sup
sup
sup
whaaaazzzzaaaaaap
what are yoooooou doing
GUYS
SERIOUSLY
whats his problem
hes cold
well yeah he sits on a frozen throne inside of icecrown glacier with a sword named frostmorn
the name icecrown glacier can only imply that among glaciers, which are themselves made of ice, this one is especially icy
its possible there is some coldness involved
_Thank_ you!
Ok, so install me a thermostat pl0x.
uh boss ixnay on asking him to install stuff
what is that supposed to mean??
uh
oh i get it
bc im an arachnid?????
and how could i possibly install a thermostat without thumbs
racist

well ok yeah how would that actually work
im sure i dont know...im just an arachnid
guess what im not ashamed of what i am
>8< spider pride
thank god
oh god
im lodging a formal protest

Sargeras is logging on now.
Aw hell.
Precisely.
Listen, I wasn't complaining earlier, the temperature is fine...

Excuse me, who is this? I'm *Lord* Jaeden to anybody that's not a Dreadlord.
listen killy there is some phylumism going down in this piece
Killy? Oh you do want to die don't you.
Also does nobody capitalize anymore?!
I didn't spend seven aeons feasting on the souls of the righteous just so I could play typing games with the functionally illiterate.
no im serious this is a real issue
*What* is a real issue?
phylum
ism
You best start talking some English
Where the hell is Sargeras?
Precisely.
Don't get cute.
i am being discriminated against on the basis of my spinal condition
What is your spinal condition?
i dont have 1
What?
im an arachnid
>8< spider power
Hey LK I thought you squished all of them already. You spent ten years on these morons and you didn't even finish the job?
what
Yeah I reanimated him. I'm the Lich King, it's sort of what I do.
So you smashed a bunch of bugs
And then you were like,
"Huh! I sure would like to have those bugs back again!"
Is your brain frozen or what?
Ok that's kind of what I was getting at before.
That you're an idiot?
ur horrible
ur a phylumist
Oh no, I'm horrible. Why don't you go and tell all my demon friends how horrible I am. They will be shocked.
phylumist phylumist phulymst phylimist

Where the hell is Sargeras
It's really not necessary, I withdraw my request completely.

An *armoire.*
Of power.

This is the worst chat ever.
The worst.
The worst.
Whatevs, titan dude. I'm done.
Still freezing my ass off though.
*wrath*
*looks around*
Chat empty?
...
I have eaten
the plums
that were in
the icebox
and which
you were probably
saving
for breakfast
Forgive me
they were delicious
so sweet
and so cold
;-)
...and that's how I spent three weeks selling fire extinguishers in Gnomeregan.
Hahaha! Oh man, in context it makes perfect sense.
So on a completely unrelated note
When are you planning to get off your ass and help us out with some Burning Crusade action
Man, I already told you
I don't do that shit anymore
I'm all about the freezing. It's, like, the _opposite_ of burning.
Please
No
Please
NO! Dude if you can't let this go, I'm logging off right now.
Man what is your deal...I don't see why you can't crusade just a little
Start the occasional bonfire
Light a scented candle once in a while...every tiny bit helps
Why won't you serve me?
You mean aside from the hideous, horrific torture?
Yeah besides that
Ok look. The whole Burning Crusade is stupid.
Why?
You have no endgame.
*cough*DestroyEveryLivingThingInTheUniverse*cough*
Ok, then what?
Then I dance on Aegwynn's corpse.
Um...ok. Then what?
Well, I'm going to be doing that for a pretty long time.
Like, three years.
I plan to really make the most of my corpse-dancing potential. I have sort of a gift, you know?
Plus Aegwynn is *such* a bitch
THEN WHAT
Dude, I dunno
Cross-stitch?
wh4t 1s up p33ps
i h4ve a ?
lets say hyp0theticaly, youd slaught3r3d somewhere in the neighborh00d of... lets say... 1,200 dwarves
Been there.
and it was m3ssy
Done that.
and now j00 cannot get t3h blood off ur talons
r3commend a cleaning pr0duct for this hypothetical situation pl0x
Dwarf blood is notoriously difficult to remove. I recommend soaking in vinegar.
o rly?
NOPE!
I WAS LYING! Vinegar will have NO EFFECT
See I DECEIVED YOU
Cuz I'm THE DECEIVER
Hahahahahahahahahahahaha
*sigh* I have never known true intimacy.
hey are j00 still cross-dress1ng these days?
Oh you know it.
w4nt to borrow my l1pst1ck?
i dont n33d it anym0re due to a lack of l1ps
Hells to the yes please.
WTF is wrong with you
I'm not actually going to wear the lipstick. I just say things like that because it's liberating.
hes r1ght
break1ng d0wn stere0types
"I loved Sex and the City."
"i urin4t3 standing up"
Try it
NO
"I call up my friends just to talk."
"i h4v3 a genuine interest in the 0utcome of footb4ll games"
"I honestly believe that lavender and mauve are different things."
"burp1ng is rel3vant to my 1nterests"
I'm not pretending I'm a woman.
So just say something random then. It'll make you feel better.
Ugh... like what?
I don't know.
How about...
"At night, I look upon potatoes with lust in my eyes."
rofl
What does that even mean? That doesn't mean anything.
I'm not saying that.
You don't have to say it...just type it
wh4ts teh harm
It's just us.
th3r3 is n0thing to ph33r
Do it
do it
Do it
do it
d0 33t
You don't even have to type it. Just copy and paste. "At night, I look upon potatoes with lust in my eyes."
You *know* you want to.
FINE. Just to make you guys stfu.
At night, I look upon potatoes with lust in my eyes.
TMIgeddon
OMG
OMFG
z0mg
3pic
3p1c
*WRATH*
Th1s 1s a gr34t day 1n h15t0ry
Hey you should probably get that fixed by the way
wh4t?
Whatever it is about your keyboard that's making you sound like a fucktard
By confusing Arabic numerals with the effing Roman alphabet.
its called 1337
What a coincidence
One thousand, three hundred thirty-seven is the exact number of dumbass script kiddies I crushed into oblivion yesterday.
*eyes LK uncertainly*
*eyes Kelthuzad uncertainly*
We will never speak of it again.
hey k3lly i have a ?
*sigh* To remove dwarf blood, soak in hydrogen peroxide then sacrifice a goat to Aule.
0h tnx
but th4t wasnt my ? this tim3
im just cur10us wh4t its lik3 to b3 a fightable b0ss
im kind4 nerv0us
ok remember when you died
um yah
imagine that, eighty times a day
0uch
actually its not so bad
its fun when raids wipe
Yeah and you can always tell which guilds are going to suck
Rule of Guild Names: The more awesome the guild name tries to sound, the more the guild sucks.
If I see, like, "Lords Of Chaos And Darkness"... done
"The Right Hand Of God"... they don't even make it through the instance
But if I ever see, like, "Ain't Misbehavin"
I'm like SHIT
XD
hey sindragosa have you seen anub'arak
n0pe
i think he h4s a l1vej0urnal though
try se4rching the web
haha get it "web"
you cant be making fun of him just bc hes a spider
y n0t?
weve been over this...remember ur sensitivity training
oh i am s3nsitive...dr4gons are a pr0ud peopl3 with a rich cultur4l heritage
r4cism is a srs issue
phylumism is just hil4rious
"hey look at me im all cool, >8< spider pride"
"oh no something larger than a golf ball"
"eeek ~8~ spider squish"
:-O
Hey show a little respect for diversity
"hmmm a complex problem, let me solve it"
"oh wait i dont have a prefrontal cortex"
"guess ill just twitch like usual"
OMG
wyrms before worms amirite
Not appropriate at all
like seriously
We were just joking before.
The Scourge does not condone this sort of thing.
Or the Legion.
At all.
At all.
dont hate
I'm out of here.
Yeah me too.
4 reals
*looks around*
Whose woods these are I think I know
His house is
Fuck it.
Oh shit oh shit oh shit
oh shit
you called, my liege
We're fucked
what did you want
We're fucked. Someone leaked one of our chat logs to the Internet.
And it got posted, like, everywhere but marthastewart.com
And Blizzard got hold of it
And now they want to meet with us to have a "powwow" about "corporate policy"
We're hosed
whos blizzard
What?
is that an ice elemental
You've got to be fing kidding me.
This had better be more important than the last time you summoned me
From my dark throne in the depths of the seething chaos in the rift between dimensions
To discuss your heating bill
one of his ice elementals is rebelling
and it wants to have a discussion
*facestab*
wait whose face are we stabbing
this is a question of some importance for me
GUYS
There's no ice elemental. Our chat log leaked and Blizzard's going to fire us.
whats t3h h33zy sh33zy
a blizzard is on fire and its leaking
rid1culous
as a fr0st wyrm i can s4y wit some auth0rity that the scenario you describe
is pretty much ret4rded
Kel'thuzad, shut up. Sindragosa, you know who Blizzard is right?
and now we're p3rs0nifying it
can i leave?
Based on past experience, I'd say our suffering has only begun.
Aaaand I'm right.
Anub, you know who Blizzard is, right?
of course
Finally. Someone who's not a complete ignoramus.
dq sells them
they are delicious
OMG ITS THE GIANT FLAMING ICE CREAM ELEMENTAL
...
What he means to say is
"Hi! How are you?"
*licks the blizzard*
Oh gross
You don't know where that's been
Also, since when do you have a tongue
Everybody be quiet please.
Yes sir.
Oh you call *him* sir.
He's from Blizzard. They're the gods of our universe.
u mean like c'th0n
No! I mean they're the Creators.
u mean like the titans
No! I mean they're behind everything we do.
u mean like that creepy gnome
Everyone! Please be quiet for a second!
what r titans
Oh for Pete's sake
EVERYBODY SHUT THE HELL UP
...
...
...
Now. We have a situation.
A chat log timestamped March 20, between some of the major Scourge and Burning Legion leaders, has been leaked to the Internet.
Followed a short time later by another.
These documents make us look, to put it charitably, ridiculous.
Lich King.
Y-yes...
You are the face of our expansion. We rely on you to project a good image for our entire brand.
Tell me. Do you find anything amusing about performing sexual acts...on a potato?
No sir. Absolutely not.
*snicker*
amusing, moar like satisfying
ahem, can u please describe said acts in greater detail
XD
The farmers' groups are already complaining.
And I'm sorry to say, you fared _best_ out of everyone.
Kil'jaeden, Kel'thuzad, and Sindragosa.
Your blatant prejudice is shocking. Our company values diversity above all. I am very disappointed in you.
tl;dr
Are you a snow cone or a chatbot? We sort of have a bet going.
Phylumism, were it an actual thing, would go against everything we stand for as a corporation.
yes thats what ive been saying thank you thank you
>8< >8> <8< <8> >8< spider priiiiiide
free at last
whose awesome
im awesome
whose awesome
im awesome
Anub'arak.
yessssssssss
You're an idiot.
Huzzah!
Azjol-Nerub and Naxxramas have become a laughingstock.
is this an 4pril f00ls j0ke
no bc if it was then kiljaeden be like "Huzzah!"
and teh chat would be like
Killzone'jaeden stands up and burps mightily "Huzzah!"
And does the hokey pokey
And LARPs
listen
we dont have to take this
Funny thing, you do, actually.
Let me introduce you to a little script I call
/beatdown
OH SHI-

It's not you numbskulls I'm worried about though.
It's this Sargeras character
Who started
An effing
Blog.
hsjjhskjdkjdkdjd
sry aftershock
Where the hell is Sargeras anyway?
Ok about that. I guarantee he did not start a blog
Yeah I can back him up on this actually. Sargeras is not what you would call...creative.
...literate.
...sentient.
I'm not wrong about this.
Oh no not this again
What are you talking about, Arthas? I'm just responding to the Blizzard summons as ordered.
I respect the wishes of our programmers.
Well I don't. Screw you Blizzard!
No it's her! She's saying that!
No, it was me. I have schizophrenia.
It's the whole two-souls-in-one-body thing.
I do NOT have schizophrenia!
Right, I'm just arguing with myself
Nothing schizo about that
It's Sylvanas! She's betraying me!
"Sylvanas" is what I call my other personality.
OMG
Make her stop
Isn't it interesting that my other personality is a woman?
*makes out with self*
Ew! Gross!
Oh right I forgot I only do it with vegetables
I could listen to this for hours.
/beatdown
OW STOP OKAY
wehgpwhghgrpihwgpghwpwghiugnibgnwiug4nuigrnibniehnrgphngrpiwhaoigwhgoihrg94984hgriruwh
dont mind me
the twitching is oddly enjoyable
Where is Sargeras?
*shrug*
I'll go get him
*sings* so ready now for ullll-du-ar
Aw man don't get that stuck in my head again
Now I'll be singing it for hours
nah it's easy to get rid of it, just insert something else even catchier
NO DON'T
this was a triumph... im making a note here, huge success
It's hard to ohhhhh-verstate my saaaaaaa-tisfaction... AAAARRRGGGGHH
*WRATH*
Sargeras isn't available at the moment.
Isn't. Available.
Um, it's a little thing called
"The Burning Crusade"
What.
http://www.wowwiki.com/Burning_Crusade
I KNOW WHAT IT IS
Well you're pretty knowledgeable for a snowcone aintcha?
...seriously?
Does *nobody* here know who I am? What Blizzard is?
Does nobody get what this is about?
Does anyone even care about the customers?
I do!
The vote of Mr. Potato Head...does not count.
Anyone else?
still twitching...
...
...
...
...done.
Ok fine. Listen, I'm going to explain it.
In the beginning there was Warcraft, and it was good.
*gets popcorn*
Then came Warcraft II and Warcraft III. But the people wanted more. And lo, Blizzard looked upon Evercrack, and saw that its power could be turned to its own purposes.
And Blizzard did smile down from upon its high throne, and release World of Warcraft unto the masses.
And WoW begat BC, which begat WotLK.
NOW do you get it?
omg tfl;dr
*sigh*
so wait
ur the one who created the titans
Yes!
ur the one who bestows patches
Yes...
ur the one who controls the pixels
Yes.
then y are u working for dairy queen
F A C E
P A L M
I AM TEH DARK TITAN!!!11
I will... destroy.. the worlds...
*sigh* My heart's just not in it today, guys.
awww
It's okay, Master. It happens to the best of us.
I myself once went three whole weeks without ripping apart anyone's soul.
Really?
...no.
I've just felt so...down, lately.
I keep getting all these "Cease And Desist" letters
When all I want to do is write on my blog
And blow up planets
And sell T-shirts at a ridiculously inflated profit margin
Yeah ABOUT THAT
Do you have any idea how many copyright laws you've violated in the past month?
You can't misuse our copyrighted works!
I *am* your copyrighted works
Aha! So you admit it!
This is an outrage!
You will stop what you're doing at once!
Blah blah blah I'm boring blah blah copyright!! >:O
OH NO SHE DIDUNT
Oh you want a piece of me?
bring it lactose boy
It's on like Donkey Kong
lets do this thing
*prepares /GMbeatdown*
*assumes dramatic stance*
*puts on Angry Eyes*
*chargin his laser*
*wets self quietly*
STOP!!!
have we lost our way? turning on one another like enemies? arent we all in this together, really?

He's right.
Really?
NO! What are you, dense? We've the villains

...
ok so, this is a chat, we cant actually fight
Right.
Right you are then
Glad that's settled.
/beatdown
AAGGGH SERIOUSLY
Listen I just wanted to say I'm sorry about the whole chat log thing
Just make sure it doesn't happen again.
Of course. Certainly not. No more chat logs posted again, ever!
And if your programmers just have a second sometime to adjust the heat settings in my throne room...
Get out of my presence!
*shiver*
That went well.
OUT!!
*sigh* Shigeru Miyamoto doesn't have to put up with this shit.

A woman has a close male friend. This means that he is probably interested in her, which is why he hangs around so much. She sees him strictly as a friend. This always starts out with, you're a great guy, but I don't like you in that way. This is roughly the equivalent for the guy of going to a job interview and the company saying, You have a great resume, you have all the qualifications we are looking for, but we're not going to hire you. We will, however, use your resume as the basis for comparison for all other applicants. But, we're going to hire somebody who is far less qualified and is probably an alcoholic. And if he doesn't work out, we'll hire somebody else, but still not you. In fact, we will never hire you. But we will call you from time to time to complain about the person that we hired.
